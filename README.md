## About
I am a scientist with interdisciplinary training in veterinary medicine,virology, neuroimmunology, and developmental biology. My research focuses on how maternal immune activation during pregnancy influences placental function, embryonic development, and long-term neurodevelopmental outcomes.

I have conducted research in international environments across Europe and the United States and have experience combining experimental models with advanced analytical and integrative approaches.
